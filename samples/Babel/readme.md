# What is this?
One goal here is to demonstrate interoperability between processes running different software stacks, using messaging as the medium, implemented using the Paramore family. This could be within a deployment boundary with a polygot service, but is most likely between two different services in a micro-services architecture.

# What do we show here
This sample has a C# producer and consumer, and a Python producer and consumer. These are derived from the single-language examples in the codebases for those languages.

To demonstrate the effectiveness of interop, you need to mix i.e. C# producer and Python consumer or vice versa.
