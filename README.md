# Contrib
This repository is for additional contributions to the Paramore project. The main focus is on tooling for use with Brighter and Darker.

Do you have an attribute and handler for NewRelic support you want to share? Or do you have an implementation of HandlerFactory for a given IoC container? A generic message mapper implementation?

Have you ever wondered the easiest way to share these, without asking us to overload the core project with these items?

Contrib is the place for those contributions.
