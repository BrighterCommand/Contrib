# **Contributors Wanted: Inquire Within** #
It isn't wise to build something that can be a part of someone's ecosystem without help, and we are always open to contributions to help us fix issues or work on features

## Getting Started ##

### Making Changes ###

- Make sure you have the latest version
- Submit a ticket for the issue, using the GitHub Issue Tracker
- It's worth checking first to see if someone else has raised your issue. We might have responded to them, or someone might be fixing it.
- If you want to add a feature, as opposed to fixing something that is broken, you should still raise an issue. 
	- That helps us understand what you want to add, so we can give more specific advice and check it does not conflict with some work in progress on a branch etc. 
	- If someone else is already working on the suggestion, then hopefully you can collaborate with them.
	- Add a comment to an issue if you pick it up to work on, so everyone else knows.
- If you have a defect please include the following:
	- Steps to reproduce the issue
	- A failing test if possible (see below)
	- The stacktrace for any errors you encountered

It is still yours, but the project is not at risk from having multiple contributors holding the copyright, with anyone able to hold it to ransom by removing their grant of licence.

The process of signing works through GitHub.
