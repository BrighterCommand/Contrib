Note that the browser cache can make KO debugging hard because it fails to pick up changes.

In FF to diable caching:

type in the address bar about:config

then press the button i'l be careful i promise

then type in the bar browser.cache.disk.enable

then double click on it, to make it false

exit firefox and restart-it.

do the same with browser.cache.memory.enable
